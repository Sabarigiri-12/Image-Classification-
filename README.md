Image-Classification-

Project Overview
      This project is an Image Classification System that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images into predefined categories. A web interface is provided where users can upload an image, and the trained model predicts the class label in real-time.

     The project demonstrates the integration of Deep Learning with Web Development, making it useful for beginners and practical applications.
